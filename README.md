**Women's Safety App**

This mobile application prioritizes the safety of women by providing them with immediate access to emergency resources in potentially risky situations.

**Features:**

- **Discreet SOS:** Trigger an alert with a pre-defined action (silent alarm, SMS/call to emergency contacts, location sharing) by pressing a power button combination or shaking the phone (customizable).
- **Emergency Contacts:** Designate trusted guardians to receive alerts with your real-time location via a Google Maps link for swift response.
- **Quick Dial:** Simplify contacting emergency services (police, ambulance, etc.) with a single tap.
- **Safety Resources:** Provide a curated list of local women's shelters, helplines, and safety tips for immediate access to support networks.
- **Optional Features (consider incorporating based on development resources):**
    - Fake Call Simulation: Mimic an incoming call to create a distraction or excuse yourself from an uncomfortable situation.
    - Record Audio/Video Evidence: Capture discreet audio or video recordings during an incident to provide potential proof.
